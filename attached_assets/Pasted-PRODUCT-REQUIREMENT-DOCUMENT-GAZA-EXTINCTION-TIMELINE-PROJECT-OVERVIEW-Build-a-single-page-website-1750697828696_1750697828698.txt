PRODUCT REQUIREMENT DOCUMENT - GAZA EXTINCTION TIMELINE
PROJECT OVERVIEW
Build a single-page website that viscerally communicates the urgency of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza through data visualization. The page should create an emotional impact while maintaining dignity and respect for the victims. This is not entertainment - it's a wake-up call.
TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 (no heavy frameworks)
Mobile-first responsive design
Core Web Vitals optimized: LCP < 2.5s, FIP < 100ms, CLS < 0.1
API: Tech for Palestine (https://data.techforpalestine.org/api/v3/summary_latest.json)
Minimal dependencies, maximum performance
Progressive enhancement approach

SECTION 1: EXTINCTION TIMELINE (Landing View)
Purpose
Show visitors immediately that Gaza faces complete annihilation at current rates.
Design Requirements

Full viewport height opening section
Dominant element: Large countdown timer showing estimated time until total population loss
Supporting visual: Calendar or timeline showing key extinction milestones
Color palette: Dark backgrounds (near black), red accents for urgency, white text
Typography: Large, bold sans-serif for numbers, readable body text

Calculation Logic
Based on Tech for Palestine API data:
- Calculate daily death rate average from last 30 days
- Total Gaza population: ~2.3 million (2024 estimate)
- Current deaths from API
- Remaining population = Total - Current deaths
- Days until extinction = Remaining population / Daily death rate
- Display as: YEARS : MONTHS : DAYS : HOURS : MINUTES
Visual Elements

Ticking countdown with smooth transitions
Subtle pulse animation on numbers
Below counter: "Until Gaza ceases to exist at current rate"
Small text showing calculation basis: "Based on [X] deaths per day average"

User Experience

No autoplay sounds
Smooth scroll hint indicator at bottom
Numbers should update in real-time but not distract

SECTION 2: LIVE CASUALTY TRACKER
Purpose
Ground the abstract countdown in real human cost.
Layout Structure
Two-column layout on desktop, stacked on mobile:

LEFT: Current Reality
- Total killed: [NUMBER]
- Children killed: [NUMBER] 
- Women killed: [NUMBER]
- Injured: [NUMBER]
- Missing: [NUMBER]

RIGHT: What Remains
- Original population: 2.3 million
- Current population: [CALCULATED]
- Percentage lost: [X]%
- Visual progress bar showing depletion
Design Specifications

Numbers animate up from 0 on scroll into view (once only)
Use monospace font for numbers to prevent layout shift
Red color intensity increases with higher numbers
Each statistic has brief context (e.g., "40% of all casualties")

Infrastructure Damage Subsection

Hospitals destroyed: [X] of [Total]
Schools destroyed: [X] of [Total]
Mosques destroyed: [X] of [Total]
Homes destroyed: [X] affecting [Y] people

Data Attribution

Clear "Data from Tech for Palestine" with timestamp
"Last updated: [TIME] ago" with auto-refresh every 5 minutes

SECTION 3: TAKE ACTION
Purpose
Convert awareness into action with clear paths to help.
Headline
"Every donation, every voice, every action slows the countdown"
Structure
Three action categories with 2-3 organizations each:
Direct Humanitarian Aid

Organization name, brief description, impact metric
Clear "DONATE" button
Show how much could help (e.g., "$50 provides medical supplies for 10 people")

Medical Support

Focus on organizations providing medical care
Emphasis on children and emergency care

Advocacy & Awareness

Organizations working on political solutions
Share/spread awareness tools

Design Approach

White background section for hope/action contrast
Green accent color for action buttons
Quick-loading organization logos
No external scripts/trackers that slow performance

Impact Visualization
Small counter showing: "If 10,000 people donate $50 each, we could provide aid for [X] months"
GLOBAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES
Tone & Messaging

Urgent but not sensationalist
Factual with emotional resonance
Respectful to victims and survivors
Action-oriented without false hope
No graphic imagery, focus on data

Performance Optimizations

Lazy load images below fold
Use CSS animations not JavaScript where possible
Debounce scroll events
Preconnect to API domain
Cache API responses for 5 minutes
Inline critical CSS

Accessibility

ARIA labels for all interactive elements
Keyboard navigation support
Screen reader friendly number updates
Sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA minimum)
Pause button for animations

Mobile Considerations

Touch-friendly tap targets (minimum 44x44px)
Reduced animation on low-power devices
Condensed statistics layout
Swipeable sections on mobile

ERROR HANDLING

Fallback to cached data if API fails
Clear error messages if data cannot be loaded
Never show broken/empty states

BROWSER SUPPORT
Modern browsers (last 2 versions), graceful degradation for older ones.
SUMMARY
Create a powerful, performance-optimized single page that makes the Gaza crisis impossible to ignore through data-driven storytelling. Every design decision should serve the goal of driving awareness and action while respecting the gravity of the situation.
