Fix the following design issues to improve user experience and emotional impact:
1. Fix Countdown Timer Display
The "23:59:42" format is confusing. Add clear labels:
23 hours : 59 minutes : 42 seconds
Or use a more intuitive format:
Today: 23h 59m 42s remaining
Make sure labels are subtle (smaller, lighter color) but visible.
2. Improve Section Spacing and Visual Weight

Add 20-30% more padding around the "Current Reality" section
Increase spacing between major sections (countdown, reality, action)
Add subtle divider lines or fade gradients between sections
Give each section room to breathe - users need time to process heavy information

3. Add Context to Progress Bar
Replace "Since October 7th, 2023, we've lost 2.43% of the population" with:
"In [X] days since October 7th, 2023:
2.43% of Gaza's 2.3 million people have been killed"
Calculate and show the actual number of days dynamically.
4. Enhance Infrastructure Section Design
Transform the simple row of numbers into a more impactful visual:

Add relevant icons for each category (hospital, school, mosque, home)
Use card-based design with subtle borders
Add percentage indicators where relevant (e.g., "36 of 42 hospitals")
Consider using progress bars or visual fills to show destruction scale
Increase font size and improve spacing

5. Add Brief Context Statement
Before "Current Reality", add a short paragraph:
"Gaza, home to 2.3 million people in just 365 square kilometers, 
is experiencing unprecedented devastation. Half the population are children."
Style this as a subtle introduction that provides essential context.
6. Smooth Emotional Transition
Between statistics and donation section, add a transitional element:

A moment of pause with increased spacing
A subtle quote or statement like "These aren't just numbers. Each represents a life, a family, a future lost."
Fade from dark statistics to hopeful action with gradient or spacing

7. Improve Action Section Hierarchy
Reorganize donation options:

Group by type more clearly (Direct Aid | Medical | Advocacy)
Make category headers more prominent
Consider featuring one "most urgent" option
Ensure consistent card heights and alignment
Add subtle hover effects to improve interactivity

8. Mobile Optimization

Ensure all tap targets are at least 44x44 pixels
Stack statistics vertically on mobile screens
Adjust font sizes for mobile readability
Test horizontal scrolling - everything should fit without side scroll
Make donation buttons full-width on mobile

9. Visual Polish

Add subtle shadows to cards for depth
Ensure consistent border radius across all elements
Add smooth transitions for any hover states
Consider subtle ambient animation (like slow gradient shift) to maintain life in the page

10. Typography Refinement

Ensure consistent font families throughout
Use proper font weights for hierarchy (thin for labels, bold for numbers)
Improve line-height for better readability
Add letter-spacing to large numbers for clarity

IMPORTANT: Maintain the serious, respectful tone throughout. These refinements should enhance clarity and impact without adding unnecessary decoration or diminishing the gravity of the subject matter.
